/**
 * A Command represents something that can be executed via user-input in an interactive session (such as the
 * "interactive" task or from the admin command bar). Commands are very similar to tasks, but differ in the following
 * ways:
 * - Orchid runs a single Task in a session, but multiple Commands may be issued in a session
 * - A Task shuts Orchid down after it completes, but a command does not
 * - A Task does not have additional parameters passed to it; rather the command-line flags act as the Task options. In
 *      contrast, additional parameters may be passed to a command directly, being extracted as an OptionsHolder
 * - A Task expects a regular String name, while Commands may be matched against a Regex pattern
