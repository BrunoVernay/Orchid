## Themes Overview

Themes in Orchid serve many functions. They provide layouts, define menus, pick the primary CSS and Javascript used on
a page, and in general provide a full webpage to hold Page content. 

Orchid themes are designed to be swapped out seamlessly, so that, in many cases, you don't need to change any 
configuration at all to give your site a completely different design. You can even use multiple themes, a new one for 
each Generator, allowing you to pick the best theme for each type of content.

Unlike many other static site generators, Orchid themes are not contained within your Orchid project, so at no point are 
you locked into using one theme forever, or requiring a ton of work to change themes.
