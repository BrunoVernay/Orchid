# Inflorescence
---

> inflorescence (noun): The arrangement of the flowers on a plant.

Inflorescence is the options-extraction framework used by Orchid. As the name implies, it is the structure of the 
individual parts of the whole Orchid, or the structure of the individual options in a class.

The project is incubating as a standalone repository and will eventually be moved to its own independently-versioned
repository in Eden.
