Compile your content using Asciidoctor.

### Using Asciidoctor with Orchid

Simply include this plugin and you're all set. Orchid will now recognize files with file extensions of `ad`, `adoc`, 
`asciidoc`, or `asciidoctor`, and compile them as Asciidoc instead of Markdown, no further configuration necessary.
